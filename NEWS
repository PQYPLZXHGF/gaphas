0.4.1
------
- Call Item._set_canvas after matrix update
- Verify if value changed before marking variable as dirty.

0.4.0
------
- allow to define connectable parts of item's (ports feature)
- implemented default connection tool (thanks to ports feature)
- line segment tool implemented (code taken from gaphor)
- implemented Item.constraint method to simplify item's constraint
  creation
- The canvas (-view) is no longer tied to the (0, 0) position. Scrolling can
  be done quite fluidly with the new PanTool implementation.
- API changes
  - use positions instead of "x, y" pairs in all method calls
